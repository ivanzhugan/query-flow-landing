# QueryFlow Landing Page - Fixed Version

## ðŸŽ‰ Git Issue Resolved!

The large file issue has been fixed. The repository now contains only the essential Next.js files without `node_modules`.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps to Deploy

### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
git push origin main
```

If you get authentication issues, you may need to:
- Set up a GitHub Personal Access Token
- Or use GitHub Desktop/CLI for authentication

### 2. Redeploy on Vercel
Once pushed to GitHub:
- Go to your Vercel dashboard
- The deployment should trigger automatically
- Or manually trigger a redeploy

### 3. Test the Deployment
The site should now work at: `https://query-flow-landing-get7.vercel.app`

## ðŸ“¦ What's Included

- âœ… Clean Next.js 14 setup
- âœ… Responsive hero section
- âœ… Animated gradient background
- âœ… Proper TypeScript configuration
- âœ… Optimized for Vercel deployment
- âœ… No large files (< 1MB total)

## ðŸ›  Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies (after git clone)
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production

```
